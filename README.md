About
-----

A tool for handling Human68k (Sharp X68000) floppy images.

It can be used for listing and extracting files from XDF and DIM images. These are the most common, and other formats can be supported if requested.

It uses the [elm-chan FatFS library](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html) for reading the FAT filesystem, with small modifications.
